Scrapoxy **hides** your scraper behind a cloud.

It starts a pool of proxies to send your requests.

Now, you can crawl without thinking about blacklisting!

It is written in Javascript (ES6) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) & [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and it is **open source**!

Latest news are on [scrapoxy.io](http://scrapoxy.io)!

See you in 1,000 years!
